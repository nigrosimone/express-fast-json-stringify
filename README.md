JSON serialization is a critical task in web development, particularly for applications built with Node.js and Express.js. While the native JSON serialization in Node.js (`JSON.stringify()`) is straightforward and convenient, it can become a performance bottleneck, especially under heavy load. This documentation introduces [express-fast-json-stringify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-fast-json-stringify), a custom middleware package that leverages [fast-json-stringify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-json-stringify) to significantly boost JSON serialization performance in Express applications.

## What is fast-json-stringify?

`fast-json-stringify` is a JSON serialization library developed by the Fastify team. It enhances JSON conversion speed by analyzing JSON schema definitions and compiling them into highly optimized serialization functions. This makes it much faster than the native `JSON.stringify()`, particularly beneficial for high-performance applications.

## Introducing express-fast-json-stringify

`express-fast-json-stringify` is an npm package that brings the performance benefits of `fast-json-stringify` to Express.js applications. By integrating this package, you can achieve faster JSON serialization, thus improving the overall performance of your application.

## Installation

First, install the `express-fast-json-stringify` package:

```
npm install express-fast-json-stringify
```

## Creating a JSON Schema

Define a schema object that specifies the structure of your JSON responses. This schema will be used by `fast-json-stringify` to optimize the serialization process.

```ts
import { Schema } from 'express-fast-json-stringify';

const schema: Schema = {
  title: 'Example Schema',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    firstName: { type: 'string' },
    lastName: { type: 'string' },
    age: {
      description: 'Age in years',
      type: 'integer',
    },
  },
};
```

## Applying the Middleware

Use the `fastJsonSchema` middleware in your Express routes, passing the schema object as an argument. This will set up the optimized JSON serialization for that route.

```ts
import express from 'express';
import { fastJsonSchema, Schema } from 'express-fast-json-stringify';

const app = express();

const exampleSchema: Schema = {
  title: 'Example Schema',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    firstName: { type: 'string' },
    lastName: { type: 'string' },
    age: { type: 'integer' },
  },
};

app.get('/', fastJsonSchema(exampleSchema), (req, res, next) => {});
```

## Sending JSON Responses

Instead of using the default `res.json()` method, use the `res.fastJson()` method provided by the middleware to send JSON responses. This leverages the speed benefits of fast-json-stringify.

```ts
import express from 'express';
import { fastJsonSchema, Schema } from 'express-fast-json-stringify';

const app = express();

const schema: Schema = {
  title: 'Example Schema',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    firstName: { type: 'string' },
    lastName: { type: 'string' },
    age: {
      description: 'Age in years',
      type: 'integer',
    },
  },
};

app.get('/', fastJsonSchema(schema), (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const data = {
      firstName: 'Simone',
      lastName: 'Nigro',
      age: 40,
    };
    res.fastJson(data);
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
});
```

## Performance Benefits

Using `express-fast-json-stringify` offers several performance benefits:

1. **Increased Speed**: `fast-json-stringify` can serialize JSON data much faster than JSON.stringify(), especially for complex JSON objects.
2. **Reduced CPU Usage**: Faster serialization means less CPU time spent on processing, allowing your server to handle more concurrent requests.
3. **Consistency and Validation**: By defining JSON schemas, you ensure that the serialized data adheres to a predefined structure, improving data consistency and reducing the likelihood of errors.

## Conclusion

Integrating `express-fast-json-stringify` into your Express.js application can provide substantial performance improvements, especially in scenarios where JSON serialization is a bottleneck. By leveraging the power of `fast-json-stringify`, you can achieve faster response times and handle higher loads, making your application more efficient and scalable.

To start using `express-fast-json-stringify`, follow the steps outlined in this documentation, and enjoy the benefits of faster JSON serialization in your Express applications. For a live demo, you can check out the [StackBlitz demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/express-fast-json-stringify).
